# Building Endeavor: A Deep Space Game with Rust and Bevy

For the past year, I've been working on **Endeavor**, a procedurally generated deep space game built entirely with **Rust** and the **Bevy Engine**. Here's what I've learned along the way.

## Why Rust for Game Development?

Coming from a background in TypeScript, Python, and C++, Rust offered something unique:

- **Memory Safety**: No null pointer crashes or data races
- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions with C++-level speed
- **Fearless Concurrency**: Easily parallelize game systems
- **Great Tooling**: Cargo makes dependency management a breeze

## The Bevy Engine

Bevy is a data-driven game engine that uses an **Entity Component System (ECS)** architecture. Some highlights:

### ECS Benefits

```rust
// Define components
#[derive(Component)]
struct Velocity(Vec3);

#[derive(Component)]
struct Position(Vec3);

// Systems automatically process entities with matching components
fn movement_system(
    time: Res<Time>,
    mut query: Query<(&mut Position, &Velocity)>,
) {
    for (mut pos, vel) in query.iter_mut() {
        pos.0 += vel.0 * time.delta_seconds();
    }
}
```

This architecture makes it easy to:

- Add new behaviors without modifying existing code
- Parallelize systems automatically
- Serialize/deserialize game state

### Procedural Universe Generation

One of Endeavor's core features is infinite procedural generation:

- **Seeded RNG**: Consistent universe across sessions
- **Chunk Loading**: Dynamic spatial partitioning
- **Star Systems**: Procedurally placed stars, planets, stations
- **Sentient Entities**: AI-driven ships with emergent behavior

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Ship Combat Complexity

Initial combat was too complex. Solution:

- Simplified to energy management system
- Clear visual feedback for weapon status
- Predictable enemy behavior patterns

### 2. Cross-Platform Rendering

Different hardware capabilities required:

- Dynamic quality settings
- Shader variants for different platforms
- Graceful degradation on low-end systems

### 3. Physics Simulation

N-body physics for realistic orbital mechanics:

- Barnes-Hut algorithm for O(n log n) complexity
- Fixed timestep for deterministic simulation
- Interpolation for smooth rendering

## What's Next?

Current focus areas:

- Steam release preparation
- Multiplayer foundation (using [Lightyear](https://github.com/cBournhonesque/lightyear))
- More variety in procedural content
- Enhanced AI for sentient entities

## Try It Out

Endeavor is available now:

- **Steam**: [Coming Soon](https://store.steampowered.com)
- **Itch.io**: [shrey.games](https://shrey.games)
